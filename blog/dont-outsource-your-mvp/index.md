# Don't Outsource Your MVP

*April 15, 2025*

Hot take of the morning: don't outsource your MVP if you're building a SaaS company.

Sincerely,
A former operator of an agency that built MVPs as a service.

I need to say that again so it sinks in. I literally ran the business that non-technical founders hired to build their MVPs. I sat on the other side of the table. I took the money, built the thing, handed it over, and watched what happened next. I have every reason to tell you that outsourcing works. I'm telling you it doesn't.

## The Iteration Problem

Here's the core issue: an MVP is not a deliverable. It's the starting line. The whole point of an MVP is to get something in front of users, learn from their behavior, and iterate fast. That feedback loop -- ship, learn, change, ship again -- is the entire game at the early stage. It's where product-market fit lives.

When you outsource your MVP, that loop breaks on day one. Every change requires going back to the agency. Another round of specs. Another scope discussion. Another invoice. Another two-week turnaround for something that should have been a same-day fix. By the time you've incorporated user feedback, your competitors have already shipped three times.

## Agencies Don't Understand Your Product

An agency will never understand your product the way a founder does. They can't. They're running five to ten projects simultaneously, context-switching between your fintech app and someone else's marketplace and another client's healthcare platform. Your product is a line item in their pipeline. To you, it's your entire world.

That gap in context matters more than people realize. The best early-stage product decisions come from someone who is deeply immersed in the problem space, talking to users every day, and has the technical ability to translate insight into code *immediately*. An agency can translate a spec into code. They cannot translate a gut feeling from a user interview into a feature pivot at 11pm on a Tuesday. That's founder energy. You can't outsource it.

## The Dependency Trap

When an agency builds your MVP, you're building a dependency on people who are going to move on. The developers who wrote your code will rotate to other projects. The engineer who made the key architecture decisions will forget the context within weeks of handoff. You'll be left with a codebase that nobody on your team fully understands, built with opinions and trade-offs that nobody on your team was present for.

I watched this happen over and over. A founder would come back to us six months after delivery needing changes, and our team had turned over. The developers who built the original product were long gone. We'd have to re-learn the codebase just to make a modification. The founder was paying agency rates for ramp-up time on their own product. It's an absurd situation, but it's the natural outcome of the outsourcing model.

## You Need Technical DNA on the Founding Team

At the earliest stage, technology decisions *are* business decisions. What to build, how to build it, what to skip, what to hack together, what to build properly -- these choices shape your product, your runway, and your ability to respond to the market. If nobody on the founding team can make those calls, you're flying blind and paying someone else to hold the controls.

I'm now the CTO and co-founder of Chipp. I see this from the inside every day. The speed at which we can move -- from idea to deployed feature -- is a direct result of having technical leadership embedded in the founding team. That speed is a competitive advantage that no agency engagement can replicate.

## Find a Technical Co-Founder

Always find a way to bring on a technical co-founder, even if it's just fractionally at first. A part-time technical co-founder who is genuinely invested in the outcome will outperform a full-time agency every single time. They'll make better architecture decisions because they'll live with the consequences. They'll iterate faster because they don't need a brief. They'll build what matters and skip what doesn't because they understand the business, not just the ticket.

If you truly cannot find a technical co-founder, at least bring on a fractional CTO who has equity and skin in the game. Someone who will be around in twelve months. Someone who cares whether the product succeeds because their upside depends on it. That's a fundamentally different relationship than a vendor-client engagement, and the results reflect it.

I built the agency. I know the model. And I'm telling you: keep the most important work in-house.
