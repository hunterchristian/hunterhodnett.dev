      <h1>I Showed Up to a Reddit Offsite in a Full Pirate Costume</h1>
      <p class="meta"><time datetime="2024-03-21">March 21, 2024</time> · <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hunterhodnett_reddit-ipod-today-which-means-that-its-activity-7176609180672262146-NyAD">Originally posted on LinkedIn</a></p>

      <p>Reddit IPO&rsquo;d today, which means it&rsquo;s story time.</p>

      <p>The scene: summer 2017, San Francisco. I had just barely squeaked through the Reddit interview process. The final round involved implementing constant-time CRUD actions for a hypothetical virtualized comment tree &mdash; which, as it turned out, wasn&rsquo;t so hypothetical. It was the first iteration of the commenting system I&rsquo;d eventually get to work on during the great Reddit redesign.</p>

      <p>I accepted the offer. Good vibes all around. And riding that wave of new-job energy, I got invited to the next Reddit offsite on Angel Island so I could meet the team before my start date. Cool. Great. Love an offsite.</p>

      <p>One small detail the recruiter mentioned: the offsite was going to be pirate themed.</p>

      <p>Now, a normal person would hear &ldquo;pirate themed&rdquo; and maybe throw on a bandana. Perhaps an eye patch if they were feeling bold. Maybe a striped shirt. But I am not a normal person. I am a person who, upon hearing &ldquo;pirate themed,&rdquo; went full cosplay. I showed up in my Dread Pirate Roberts halloween costume &mdash; the whole thing &mdash; thinking I was about to make the best first impression of my career.</p>

      <p>No one else dressed up. Not a single person. The company was about 200 people at the time, and every last one of them was in normal human clothing. Jeans. T-shirts. Maybe a Patagonia vest if they were feeling fancy. And then there was me, standing on a ferry to Angel Island, dressed like I was about to commandeer the vessel.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;d love to tell you that everyone thought it was hilarious and I became an instant legend. The truth is more like polite smiles and a lot of &ldquo;oh, you actually&hellip; okay.&rdquo; It was the kind of social moment that builds character, which is what people say when they mean it was mortifying.</p>

      <p>Lesson learned: when attending quasi-themed corporate functions, always hedge your bets and pack all costume apparel in a backpack. Scout the vibe first. Escalate only if the environment supports it. This has been a public service announcement.</p>
