      <h1>The Collapse of Builder.ai: Causes, Legal Troubles, Leadership, and Timeline</h1>
      <p class="meta"><time datetime="2025-05-20">May 20, 2025</time> · <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hunterhodnett_collapse-builderai-causes-legal-troubles-leadership-timeline-hodnett-j8v8e">Originally posted on LinkedIn</a></p>

      <p><a href="http://Builder.ai">Builder.ai</a> &mdash; a once high-flying <strong>AI startup</strong> valued at over $1 billion &mdash; has collapsed into insolvency as of May 2025. This report examines the factors behind Builder.ai&rsquo;s bankruptcy, including internal financial missteps, legal challenges facing its leadership, and a timeline of events from 2023&ndash;2025 that charts the company&rsquo;s meteoric rise and dramatic fall. We draw on media coverage from Indian, UK, and global outlets to provide a comprehensive view of the company&rsquo;s downfall.</p>

      <h2>Background: From Startup Unicorn to Insolvency</h2>
      <p><a href="http://Builder.ai"><strong>Builder.ai</strong></a> (founded in 2016 and formerly known as <a href="http://Engineer.ai"><em>Engineer.ai</em></a>) set out to <em>&ldquo;use artificial intelligence to build apps and websites&rdquo;</em>, comparing the process to ordering a pizza. The London-headquartered company offered a platform to let customers build software with minimal coding, and it attracted high-profile backers including Microsoft and SoftBank&rsquo;s DeepCore fund. Over multiple funding rounds it raised roughly <strong>$445&ndash;450 million</strong>, reaching <em>unicorn</em> status (valuation &ge; $1&nbsp;billion) after a <strong>$250 million Series D</strong> led by the Qatar Investment Authority in May 2023. This infusion, amid the 2023 generative AI boom, brought Builder.ai&rsquo;s total funding to over $450&nbsp;million and cemented its reputation as one of the UK&rsquo;s most-hyped startups.</p>

      <p>However, behind the hype, <strong>issues were brewing</strong>. Early on, Builder.ai courted controversy when it claimed to have a largely automated app-building platform, whereas in reality it relied heavily on human engineers &mdash; a fact exposed in 2019. This <em>&ldquo;minor scandal&rdquo;</em> foreshadowed later troubles with transparency. By late 2023, even as founder Sachin Dev Duggal was being lauded &mdash; Ernst &amp; Young named him UK &ldquo;Entrepreneur of the Year&rdquo; in November 2023 &mdash; serious cracks had begun to appear in Builder.ai&rsquo;s operational and financial foundations.</p>

      <h2>Financial Missteps and &ldquo;Historic Challenges&rdquo;</h2>
      <p>Several <strong>strategic and financial missteps</strong> precipitated Builder.ai&rsquo;s collapse. The company itself acknowledged it <em>&ldquo;has been unable to recover from historic challenges and past decisions that placed significant strain on its financial position&rdquo;</em>. Key factors include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Overstated Revenues and Inflated Sales:</strong> In 2024, Builder.ai internally revised and <strong>lowered its revenue estimates by 25%</strong> for the second half of the year after discovering actual sales were far lower than projections. Whistleblowers alleged that the startup <strong>inflated its sales figures by over 20%</strong> on multiple occasions. These revelations indicated that prior reported growth was overstated, creating a misleading picture of the company&rsquo;s health.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Accounting Irregularities and Audit Failures:</strong> The <strong>integrity of Builder.ai&rsquo;s financial oversight</strong> came into question. Its main subsidiary in India saw a string of auditor resignations, and the firm <em>&ldquo;relied on an auditor with long-standing links to its founder&rdquo;</em> for its UK accounts &mdash; raising conflict-of-interest concerns. In fact, two small auditing firms that handled certain subsidiaries quit in rapid succession (one had even audited the failed crypto fund Three Arrows Capital). The <strong>CFO&rsquo;s abrupt resignation in July 2023</strong> left a leadership void in finance. Only in 2025 did Builder.ai engage Big Four auditors to conduct its first-ever group-wide audit, underscoring a previously lax approach to oversight. These lapses meant that problems went undetected or unaddressed for too long.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Cash Burn and Operational Overreach:</strong> Flush with investor cash, Builder.ai <strong>scaled aggressively</strong>, growing to around <em>770 employees</em> across the UK, India, Singapore and beyond. This rapid expansion drove up costs. By early 2025 the new management cut roughly <strong>270 jobs</strong> (over one-third of staff) in a <em>&ldquo;significant restructuring&rdquo;</em> to reduce expenses. The company&rsquo;s business model &mdash; selling custom app development touted as &ldquo;AI-built&rdquo; &mdash; may have also been less profitable than advertised, given the manual work involved. Combined with a general downturn in late-2022/2023 venture funding, these factors led to <strong>cash flow problems</strong>. Ultimately, Builder.ai ran short on runway and was unable to secure additional capital in time, forcing insolvency.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Past Decisions and Mismanagement:</strong> New CEO Manpreet Ratia candidly admitted there had been <em>&ldquo;problems&rdquo;</em> under past leadership. Some revenue shortfalls were attributed to deals that fell through &mdash; for example, certain Middle Eastern reseller arrangements did not deliver expected sales, prompting a <strong>restatement of 2023 revenues down to $140&nbsp;million</strong> (from a higher figure that was not disclosed publicly). Builder.ai&rsquo;s leadership seemingly prioritized explosive growth over robust internal controls. As Ratia observed, <em>&ldquo;Do we have problems? Absolutely. Any organisation who comes and says everything is hunky-dory is probably lying.&rdquo;</em> This culture of optimism-at-all-costs, coupled with weaknesses in execution, set the stage for a financial crunch.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>In short, <strong>over-optimistic sales reporting, inadequate financial controls, high burn rate, and leadership blind spots</strong> all contributed to the startup&rsquo;s failure. By the time these issues came to light, investor confidence had eroded and it was too late to save the company.</p>

      <h2>Legal Challenges and Investigations in India</h2>
      <p>Compounding Builder.ai&rsquo;s troubles were serious <strong>legal issues involving its founder and a co-founder</strong> &mdash; especially in India. In early 2024, the Financial Times revealed that Indian authorities had implicated the men behind Builder.ai in separate long-running fraud investigations:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Money Laundering Probe (Sachin Dev Duggal):</strong> Sachin Dev Duggal &mdash; Builder.ai&rsquo;s co-founder and CEO &mdash; was named as a suspect by India&rsquo;s Enforcement Directorate (ED) in a <em>money laundering</em> investigation related to the collapse of Videocon, a large Indian conglomerate. The probe centers on <strong>financial dealings from 2008&ndash;2012</strong> in which funds from Videocon were allegedly routed through a company Duggal had founded, then moved to Videocon&rsquo;s overseas entities. Indian investigators described several <em>&ldquo;unexplained transactions&rdquo;</em> between Videocon and Duggal or his firms. Notably, Duggal was summoned by the ED in 2022 to explain these transactions but did not appear, claiming UK citizenship and non-residency in India. By 2023 the ED had shifted his status from witness to suspect and obtained a non-bailable arrest warrant from a Delhi court. <em>(Mr. Duggal is appealing the warrant and has</em> <strong><em>denied any wrongdoing</em></strong> <em>through his lawyers.)</em></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Bank Loan Fraud Case (Saurabh Dhoot):</strong> <em>Saurabh Dhoot</em> &mdash; a close friend of Duggal&rsquo;s who had been informally referred to as a co-founder &mdash; is <strong>accused in a loan fraud case</strong> related to Videocon. Dhoot is a member of Videocon&rsquo;s founding family (a nephew of Videocon&rsquo;s chairman) and was allegedly involved in a scheme to secure fraudulent loans from an Indian bank, facilitated by his uncle Venugopal Dhoot, with misallocated funds flowing into various Videocon accounts. In other words, authorities claim Saurabh Dhoot participated in financial misconduct tied to the infamous ICICI Bank-Videocon loan scandal. He too faces charges in India, though these relate to his family&rsquo;s business dealings prior to Builder.ai.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Both men <strong>vigorously contest these allegations</strong>. Duggal&rsquo;s representatives characterize the money-laundering case as a misunderstanding unrelated to Builder.ai, maintaining that <em>&ldquo;his involvement&hellip; is a misinterpretation&rdquo;</em> and that he has cooperated with investigators. Dhoot&rsquo;s lawyers similarly dismiss the fraud accusations as baseless or premature. Importantly, <strong>Builder.ai&rsquo;s operations were not implicated</strong> &mdash; the company and its counsel have stressed that the probes concern the founders&rsquo; <em>&ldquo;past business engagements&rdquo;</em> and not Builder.ai itself.</p>

      <p>Nevertheless, these legal troubles cast a long shadow. Media reports of a <em>Microsoft-backed</em> CEO entangled in a money-laundering probe &mdash; and a co-founder tied to bank fraud &mdash; hurt Builder.ai&rsquo;s reputation. The FT noted that such developments &ldquo;could raise questions over the startup&rsquo;s leadership&rdquo; even if Builder.ai wasn&rsquo;t directly involved. Indeed, as scrutiny intensified in 2024, Builder.ai appears to have quietly distanced itself from Saurabh Dhoot&rsquo;s involvement. Lawyers for the company claimed that while Dhoot had at times been <strong>referred to as a co-founder</strong>, this was <em>&ldquo;in recognition of the friendship and advice he had provided&rdquo;</em> to Duggal rather than an operational role. They emphasized Dhoot was <strong>not involved in setting up</strong> the startup&rsquo;s UK entity or its prior venture (Nivio) in any substantive way. In reality, Duggal and Dhoot had met in university and co-founded an earlier tech startup (cloud computing firm <em>Nivio</em> in the mid-2000s), forging a partnership that later carried into Builder.ai&rsquo;s story. But as legal heat turned up, Builder.ai moved to <strong>&ldquo;set the record straight&rdquo;</strong> &mdash; scrubbing or clarifying Dhoot&rsquo;s role in the company&rsquo;s narrative.</p>

      <p>In summary, while <strong>these cases stemmed from the founders&rsquo; past connections to Videocon</strong>, their surfacing was disastrous for Builder.ai&rsquo;s leadership credibility. The timing coincided with the company&rsquo;s financial struggles, fueling negative press and perhaps alarming investors (particularly given Builder.ai&rsquo;s significant base in India). The founder&rsquo;s attention was split between firefighting a public relations/legal crisis and managing the company&rsquo;s troubles at a critical juncture.</p>

      <h2>Leadership and Governance Issues</h2>
      <p><strong>Sachin Dev Duggal</strong>, Builder.ai&rsquo;s co-founder and CEO (often styling himself as the company&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;Chief Wizard&rdquo;</em>), was the public face of the startup through its ascent &mdash; and many of its problems can be traced to leadership decisions and company culture under his tenure. Duggal had a reputation as a charismatic entrepreneur; as noted, he garnered accolades and positioned Builder.ai as a revolutionary force in software development. However, <strong>internal accounts depicted a more troubled leadership style</strong>. A 2024 FT investigation (aptly subtitled &ldquo;the wild ride of a Microsoft-backed tech unicorn&rdquo;) revealed testimony from former employees critical of Duggal&rsquo;s management. They complained about his <strong>leadership approach, the company&rsquo;s high-pressure culture, and chronic challenges in delivering projects on time</strong>. Some enterprise customers were unhappy with delayed or incomplete software deliveries, though the company&rsquo;s lawyers attributed those cases to <em>&ldquo;unforeseen technical challenges&rdquo;</em> or clients pausing projects mid-stream. This disconnect between the rosy picture painted by leadership and on-the-ground execution issues hinted at <strong>organizational dysfunction</strong>.</p>

      <p>Moreover, as CEO, Duggal made <strong>questionable governance choices</strong>. The decision to use a small auditor connected to him personally to sign off accounts, and the rapid auditor turnover in subsidiaries, reflect a <em>&ldquo;move fast, fix later&rdquo;</em> mindset that ultimately backfired. The absence of a permanent CFO after mid-2023 (when the finance chief resigned) meant there was arguably <strong>insufficient financial discipline</strong> just as the company was flush with new funds and expanding. It was under these conditions that revenue overstatement and other lapses occurred. Insiders have suggested that Duggal, a product visionary, may have paid less attention to building robust internal controls during the growth spurt.</p>

      <p>By late 2024, with Builder.ai&rsquo;s challenges mounting and his own legal cloud growing, <strong>pressure from investors</strong> led to a change at the top. On <strong>February 27, 2025</strong>, Sachin Duggal stepped down as CEO, relinquishing day-to-day control. He was replaced by <strong>Manpreet Ratia</strong>, a seasoned executive (and notably, a managing partner at one of Builder.ai&rsquo;s investors, Jungle Ventures). This leadership transition was framed positively &mdash; <em>&ldquo;after eight years of growth, bringing in fresh perspective and operational excellence is crucial for our next phase,&rdquo;</em> Duggal said of the handover &mdash; but it was clearly a remedial move. Duggal moved into a purely strategic role as &ldquo;Founder and Chief Wizard&rdquo; and remained on the board (at least initially), while Ratia took charge of day-to-day management.</p>

      <p><strong>Manpreet Ratia&rsquo;s mandate</strong> was essentially to clean up and turn around the ship. His early actions in Q1 2025 included commissioning thorough audits (engaging <em>BDO</em> and other big firms to audit 2023&ndash;2027 accounts), <strong>slashing workforce and costs</strong> as mentioned, and revisiting the company&rsquo;s financial reporting. Under Ratia, Builder.ai openly admitted to prior errors &mdash; restating revenues and acknowledging the <em>&ldquo;problems&rdquo;</em> left behind by past leadership. Ratia emphasized getting the company&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;house in order&rdquo;</em>, even as he still voiced optimism about Builder.ai&rsquo;s core business potential. His comments to the press reflected a mix of candor and resolve: rather than denying the discrepancies outright, he allowed that discounts and accounting practices might have caused confusion, and awaited the independent audit results to <em>&ldquo;tell me everything.&rdquo;</em></p>

      <p>Despite these efforts, the turnaround time proved too short. The <strong>damage to trust and finances</strong> had been done under the previous regime, and even new leadership could not persuade investors to inject fresh capital by 2025. In April 2025, Ratia conceded to the FT that parts of Builder.ai&rsquo;s growth story had been illusory, remarking, <em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a great business and, trust me, I wouldn&rsquo;t be sitting here if I did not believe in [it]. [But]&hellip; any organization who says everything is fine is probably lying.&rdquo;</em> It was an honest assessment: the company still had a solid product and real customers (even boasting big names like JPMorgan Chase as clients), but <strong>leadership mistakes</strong> &mdash; from aggressive promises to insufficient oversight &mdash; had pushed it to a breaking point.</p>

      <h2>Timeline of Key Events (2023&ndash;2025)</h2>
      <p>Below is a chronological timeline highlighting major events and turning points leading up to Builder.ai&rsquo;s bankruptcy:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>2016&ndash;2019:</strong> Builder.ai is founded (2016) as <a href="http://Engineer.ai"><em>Engineer.ai</em></a>, promoting an AI-driven app development platform. It gains early traction and media attention, but a 2019 expos&eacute; shows the platform was heavily human-powered despite AI marketing. Sachin Duggal and Saurabh Dhoot establish their partnership (having previously co-founded a startup called Nivio in the 2000s).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>May 2023:</strong> <em>Peak funding and valuation.</em> Builder.ai raises <strong>$250&nbsp;million in Series D funding</strong> led by Qatar&rsquo;s sovereign wealth fund (QIA), with Insight Partners, Iconiq Capital and others participating. This brings total raised to over $450&nbsp;million and reportedly values the company above $1&nbsp;billion (unicorn status). Microsoft also deepens a partnership (it had made a strategic investment and planned integrations with Azure/Teams) to support Builder.ai&rsquo;s growth. The company announces plans to invest the capital in expanding talent, partnerships, and technology R&amp;D.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>July 2023:</strong> <strong>Chief Financial Officer resigns.</strong> Builder.ai&rsquo;s CFO exits the company just weeks after the big funding round (the company later confirms it was <em>&ldquo;searching for a new CFO&rdquo;</em> after the previous one left in July). The departure of a key financial executive at this juncture is a red flag, though not publicized at the time.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Mid/Late 2023:</strong> <strong>Mounting internal issues.</strong> As the new fiscal year unfolds, Builder.ai&rsquo;s financial performance <strong>lags behind projections</strong>. By the summer of 2024, the company quietly lowers its revenue forecast for H2 2024 by ~25%, implying that by late 2023 it already realized sales were falling short. Meanwhile, Sachin Duggal receives the EY <em>Entrepreneur of the Year UK 2023</em> award in November, even as behind the scenes the company&rsquo;s growth story is beginning to unravel. Around the same time (late 2022 into 2023), <strong>Indian authorities escalate their Videocon-related investigations</strong>: Duggal is named in an ED warrant application in India (he allegedly failed to respond to a 2022 summons), but this fact remains largely out of public view until 2024.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>March 2024:</strong> <strong>Founder controversies erupt publicly.</strong> The Financial Times publishes a detailed report (in mid-to-late March) revealing that Builder.ai&rsquo;s co-founders are <em>&ldquo;named in money laundering and fraud probes&rdquo;</em> in India. Global and Indian media pick up the story: <strong>Sachin Dev Duggal is alleged to be involved in laundering Videocon funds</strong>, and <strong>Saurabh Dhoot is implicated in an Indian bank loan fraud case</strong>. Court documents and investigative details from India are cited, casting a shadow on Builder.ai&rsquo;s leadership. In response, Builder.ai issues statements to <em>&ldquo;set the record straight&rdquo;</em>, emphasizing that these legal matters pertain to the individuals&rsquo; past dealings (e.g. Nivio/Videocon) and not to Builder.ai&rsquo;s operations. The company downplays Dhoot&rsquo;s role, updating materials to clarify he was more of an advisor than a formal co-founder. Duggal <strong>denies wrongdoing</strong> and continues to lead the company at this point. Nonetheless, the bad press not only harms the startup&rsquo;s image but also raises investor concerns about governance.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Late 2024:</strong> <strong>Financial alarms and restatements.</strong> Under investor pressure, Builder.ai begins a thorough review of its finances. Multiple statutory auditors had resigned in prior years (2017 onwards) for certain units, and now the company&rsquo;s new auditors and management uncover that revenue had been overstated. By the end of 2024, Builder.ai prepares to <strong>restate its financial accounts</strong>. Notably, what was previously reported as 2023 revenue is revised down to <strong>$140&nbsp;million</strong> after removing unrealized sales from Middle East channel partners. These adjustments signal that growth was slower than reported. Internally, plans are made for cost-cutting to extend the runway, as the window for raising new funds narrows. The board likely begins succession planning given the twin crises (financial and reputational).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>February 2025:</strong> <strong>Leadership shake-up.</strong> On Feb 27, 2025, <strong>Sachin Dev Duggal steps down as CEO</strong> of Builder.ai, amid mounting pressure and &ldquo;embattled founder&rdquo; headlines. He is <strong>replaced by Manpreet Ratia</strong> &mdash; a senior figure from investor Jungle Ventures &mdash; as the new CEO tasked with turning the company around. Duggal stays on the board (initially) and assumes the ceremonial title of <em>Chief Wizard</em>, but day-to-day control passes to Ratia. The leadership transition is announced publicly in early March and framed as positioning Builder.ai for its &ldquo;next phase of growth&rdquo;. Behind the scenes, it also helps assuage investors and partners that fresh oversight is in place.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>March&ndash;April 2025:</strong> <strong>Restructuring and admissions.</strong> Under Ratia&rsquo;s leadership, Builder.ai undertakes drastic measures to stabilize. In March, the company <strong>cuts ~270 jobs</strong> (~35% of its ~770 employees) to reduce costs, as reported by FT and other outlets. This is described as part of a <em>&ldquo;significant restructuring&rdquo;</em> alongside the financial restatements. The new CEO brings in <strong>BDO</strong> and two Big-4 accounting firms to audit the books for 2023&ndash;2027, instituting the first-ever group-level audit and tightening controls. In early April 2025, Builder.ai (via Ratia) publicly acknowledges past <strong>accounting &ldquo;problems&rdquo;</strong> and confirms that previously overstated revenues have been corrected downward. The <em>Financial Times</em> also runs a piece detailing how Builder.ai <em>&ldquo;relied on an auditor linked to the founder&rdquo;</em> and noting the company was now bringing in top-tier auditors and even searching for a new CFO. Ratia gives frank interviews signaling that while the core business is sound, mismanagement under prior leadership took a serious toll. During this period, any hopes of raising a new funding round are dimming &mdash; investors adopt a wait-and-see stance pending the outcome of audits, and no white-knight acquirer emerges.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>May 2025:</strong> <strong>Insolvency and collapse.</strong> By mid-May, it becomes clear that Builder.ai cannot continue as a going concern. On <strong>May 20, 2025</strong>, Builder.ai <strong>announces it is entering insolvency proceedings</strong> and will appoint an administrator to manage the process. Employees are informed of the dire situation in a company-wide call that day. The company&rsquo;s LinkedIn account posts the news, and a spokesperson confirms to media that an administrator will take over &ldquo;to manage the company&rsquo;s affairs&rdquo;. In its public statement, Builder.ai expresses regret and cites <em>&ldquo;historic challenges and past decisions&rdquo;</em> that left it financially crippled despite the team&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;tireless efforts&rdquo;</em>. The immediate focus, the company says, is on supporting employees and clients through the transition and possibly salvaging parts of the business via asset sales. This dramatic fall from unicorn status is widely covered in press globally. The <strong>Financial Times</strong> headlines the story as <em>&ldquo;Microsoft-backed UK tech unicorn Builder.ai collapses into insolvency&rdquo;</em>, underscoring the shock of such a prominent startup&rsquo;s failure. Indian outlets note the collapse with reference to the founder&rsquo;s legal woes, while tech media like <strong>TechCrunch</strong> chronicle how a company <em>&ldquo;once worth over $1B&rdquo;</em> ran out of money.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Post-May 2025 (Aftermath):</strong> As of this report, insolvency professionals are taking stock of Builder.ai&rsquo;s assets and liabilities. The process will determine if any parts of the business (such as its software platform or IP) can be sold or restructured. Sachin Duggal&rsquo;s future with the company is uncertain &mdash; having already resigned his directorship in the UK entity by March, he may have no formal role left if the company is liquidated. Investors including QIA, Insight, and Microsoft are likely writing off their investments. The collapse has prompted reflection in the startup community about governance: even a well-funded, well-connected startup can rapidly implode due to internal lapses. One year ago, Builder.ai was at the peak of the AI hype cycle; now it stands as a sobering example of <strong>how financial discipline and trust are as crucial as visionary technology</strong> in sustaining a business.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Builder.ai&rsquo;s bankruptcy was not caused by any single event, but by a <strong>confluence of internal failings and external pressures</strong>. On one hand, <strong>financial mismanagement</strong> &mdash; inflated sales reporting, inadequate audits, and uncontrolled spending &mdash; meant the company was weaker than it appeared. On the other, <strong>leadership issues</strong> and the founders&rsquo; <em>prior entanglements</em> (the Videocon-linked investigations) eroded confidence and distracted from the business. Market conditions for fundraising tightened just as Builder.ai needed a lifeline, and high-profile backers were unwilling to double down given the governance red flags. As the company itself conceded, <em>historic decisions</em> had &ldquo;placed significant strain&rdquo; on its finances, and ultimately it <strong>could not recover</strong>.</p>

      <p>The collapse of Builder.ai has been extensively covered in the media, from <strong>London to New Delhi</strong>. The <em>Financial Times</em> chronicled the startup&rsquo;s wild ride and downfall, while Indian outlets like <em>Moneycontrol</em> and <em>Business Today</em> highlighted the cautionary tale of celebrated tech entrepreneurs facing legal scrutiny at home. In the end, Builder.ai&rsquo;s story serves as a reminder that no amount of hype or funding can compensate for flawed fundamentals. <strong>Transparency, prudent management, and sound governance</strong> are essential &mdash; especially for a unicorn scaling at breakneck speed. Lacking these, Builder.ai&rsquo;s ambitious vision to &ldquo;democratize&rdquo; software development fell apart, leaving investors, employees, and customers in the lurch. The company that once promised to build apps &ldquo;six times faster and 70% cheaper&rdquo; will now be remembered as one of the tech industry&rsquo;s stark lessons in how startups can go astray.</p>
