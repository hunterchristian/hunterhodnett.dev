      <p>Can you imagine if other engineering disciplines used the same development methodologies as software engineering?</p>

      <p><strong>Civil engineering, but Agile.</strong> &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to build this bridge in two-week sprints. At the end of Sprint 1 we&rsquo;ll have a walkable MVP &mdash; just two planks and a rope. We&rsquo;ll iterate from there based on user feedback.&rdquo; The bridge collapses. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll address that in the retro.&rdquo;</p>

      <p><strong>Mechanical engineering, but with hotfixes.</strong> A car rolls off the assembly line missing a brake pad. &ldquo;Ship it. We&rsquo;ll push a hotfix to production tonight.&rdquo; The mechanic patches the brake pad on at 2 AM in the customer&rsquo;s driveway while they sleep. Nobody files an incident report.</p>

      <p><strong>Aerospace engineering, but with &ldquo;move fast and break things.&rdquo;</strong> &ldquo;We know the left wing isn&rsquo;t fully attached but we need to hit our Q3 launch target. We&rsquo;ll fix it in v1.1.&rdquo; There is no v1.1.</p>

      <p><strong>Structural engineering, but with technical debt.</strong> &ldquo;Yeah, the foundation is held together with duct tape and prayers, but we&rsquo;ll refactor it next quarter.&rdquo; Next quarter: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have capacity to refactor the foundation. Let&rsquo;s just add another floor on top.&rdquo;</p>

      <p><strong>Electrical engineering, but with Stack Overflow.</strong> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to wire this substation, but I found a seven-year-old answer with three upvotes. Let&rsquo;s go with that.&rdquo;</p>

      <p><strong>Nuclear engineering, but with CI/CD.</strong> Every commit to the reactor&rsquo;s control system automatically deploys to production. The test suite is two unit tests, both of which are skipped. Green pipeline.</p>

      <p><strong>Biomedical engineering, but with A/B testing.</strong> &ldquo;Half the patients get the working pacemaker. The other half get the experimental one we wrote in Rust over the weekend. We&rsquo;ll compare outcomes in 30 days.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>The fact that software engineering gets away with this stuff is either a testament to how forgiving software is, or how terrifying our industry should be to everyone else.</p>

      <p>Probably both.</p>
