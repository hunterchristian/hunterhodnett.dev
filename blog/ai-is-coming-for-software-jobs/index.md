# AI Is Coming for Software Jobs

*June 15, 2025*

Anyone who thinks that AI isn't coming for software jobs hasn't run claude-4-opus in Cursor on max mode.

Feed capital in one side (pay for token usage), get a product out the other. Capital leverage like the world has never seen.

I'm not being hyperbolic. At Chipp, I watched what used to take a team of engineers weeks get compressed into hours. Not because the AI is perfect — it's not — but because the iteration cycle went from "write a ticket, assign it, wait for a sprint" to "describe what you want, review the output, ship it."

The economics are brutal if you're on the wrong side of this. A founder with taste, a credit card, and a frontier model can now produce software output that previously required a funded engineering org. That's not a future prediction. That's today.

The gap between "idea" and "working product" has never been smaller. And it's shrinking fast.
