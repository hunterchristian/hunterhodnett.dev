I've spent 14 years building software in the consumer technology industry — 9 as an engineer at places like Reddit, Amazon Music, and The Home Depot, and the last 5 as a founder.

These days I lead product and engineering at Chipp, where we're making it easy for anyone to create and deploy AI-powered apps.

## What does Hunter work on?

Hunter is the CPTO and Co-founder of **Chipp**, a no-code AI platform serving over 16,000 builders with more than 80,000 apps reaching 36 million users. Chipp brings software margins to service industries by connecting non-traditional software buyers with pre-built AI tooling that fits their niche use cases.

Before Chipp, Hunter founded **Cottage**, a marketplace that crowd-sourced MVPs for non-technical startup founders while providing junior engineers with real-world coding experience. Cottage laid the groundwork for Chipp by exploring how to bridge the gap between non-traditional software buyers and SaaS solutions.
